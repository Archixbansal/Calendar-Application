# Calendar-Application
Developed a Calendar Application utilizing Data Structures and Algorithms, written in C++. Engineered a user-friendly interface allowing users to access and manage important dates effortlessly. Implemented functionalities to display monthly calendars, leveraging algorithms for accurate date calculations and efficient navigation.
